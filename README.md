Project Description:
Real Estate Application is a web application that allows users to manage real estate listings. The project was developed using ASP.NET Core MVC and covered the entire lifecycle of web application development â€“ from designing the user interface to implementing business logic and integrating with the database.

Application Functionalities:
    Category Management: Enables administrators to add, edit, and delete real estate categories, which helps in better organizing the listings.
    Offer Types Management: Similar to category management, this feature allows configuration of different offer types, such as sale, rent, etc.
    Offer Browsing: Users can browse available offers using advanced filters (e.g., by price, city, property type).
    Offer Details: The application displays detailed information about each offer, including photos, description, location, and contact details.
    Favorites: Users can add offers to their favorites, allowing easy access to preferred listings.
    Mortgage Calculator: A tool for calculating monthly mortgage payments based on the property price, down payment, and loan term.
    Authorization: Implements authorization mechanisms that restrict access to the administrative panel to logged-in users with appropriate permissions.
    Google Login: Provides the option for users to log in using their Google accounts for a seamless authentication experience.
    Hybrid Pagination and Infinite Scroll: Allows users to smoothly browse the list of offers by using hybrid pagination and infinite scrolling.
    Integration with Web Services: Supports web services such as OpenStreetMap and GeoNames for accessing place registries and mapping real estate locations.
